# MySQL Employee Tracker [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
I created this Employee Tracker for a company to use to be able to manage their employee database. They can create various departments, roles within those departments, and employees within those roles. The user can also update employee roles in the database to reflect actual changes within the company.
